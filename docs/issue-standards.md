# Issue Standards

This document defines the issue title and label standards for this project's GitHub issues.
Agents must follow it when opening or modifying issues.

## Issue Body Update Rules

Issue updates must keep the management plane deterministic and reviewable. The canonical
body-update mechanism is `scripts/issue-markdown.mjs` — a pure section-replace transform — applied
with a native GitHub call (`gh issue edit --body-file` for Codex/Agy, `mcp__github__issue_write`
for Claude Code).

### Default rule

Prefer **section-targeted updates** over full body replacement.

Use a section update when you are changing a known heading such as:

- `Acceptance criteria`
- `Open questions`
- `Feature Tracking`
- `Test plan`
- `Workflow classification`

Section updates preserve all untouched sections, plus labels, milestone, comments, and linked issue
metadata that live outside the body.

The canonical section parser targets level-2 headings in the form `## Heading`. Nested subheadings
remain part of the enclosing section content.

### Full replacement rule

Use **full replacement** only when one of these is true:

- Bootstrapping a brand-new issue from a template
- Migrating a legacy or malformed issue body into the canonical structure
- Performing a deliberate issue-wide rewrite after a material reframing of the work

When replacing the full body, the agent must preserve any still-valid governance content such as:

- `**Epic:** #<id>` links on child issues
- Existing `## Feature Tracking` task lists on epic issues
- Any accepted execution checks or acceptance criteria that remain in scope

If the issue needs a substantive requirement change, document it in the body update and continue.
Do not block waiting for human input unless a real decision is required.

### Authority and ownership

- Agent-created issues are agent-managed by default.
- Humans may refine direction through issue comments; agents should fold resolved answers back into
  the body when they clarify the source of truth.
- Workflow-status comments are separate from body updates and must not be treated as body sections.
- Labels, milestones, and lifecycle metadata are managed explicitly and are not inferred from body
  edits alone.

### Canonical update commands

Prefer these over ad hoc `gh issue edit --body` rewrites:

```bash
# Fetch the current body
gh issue view 123 --json body --jq '.body' > .agent-runs/scratch/123-body.md

# Update one canonical section while preserving the rest of the issue body
node scripts/issue-markdown.mjs --section "Feature Tracking" \
  --replacement tracking.md --body .agent-runs/scratch/123-body.md > .agent-runs/scratch/123-new-body.md

# Append a missing canonical section when needed
node scripts/issue-markdown.mjs --section "Test plan" \
  --replacement test-plan.md --create-if-missing --body .agent-runs/scratch/123-body.md > .agent-runs/scratch/123-new-body.md

# Apply the updated body with native GitHub tooling
gh issue edit 123 --body-file .agent-runs/scratch/123-new-body.md
# Claude Code: use mcp__github__issue_write with the new body instead
```

For full replacement, construct the new body directly — preserving the governance content listed
above — and apply it the same way. `scripts/issue-markdown.mjs` only performs section-targeted
updates.

## Issue Titles

All issue titles must start with one of these exact Conventional Commit prefixes:

- `feat:` - user-facing product capability or feature work
- `fix:` - defect, regression, or security bug fix
- `chore:` - repository maintenance, documentation, process, or agent workflow work
- `refactor:` - code restructuring without intended behavior changes
- `build:` - build, CI, packaging, release, or infrastructure automation changes
- `qa:` - exploratory QA sessions, QA session planning/execution, or QA evidence work

Rules:

- Use the exact lowercase prefix, including the trailing colon.
- Do not use scoped prefixes such as `fix(cli):` unless this standard is updated.
- Do not use legacy title markers such as `[Epic]`, `epic:`, `Feature:`, or `Chore:`.
- Use labels to communicate issue type, epic status, routing, and lifecycle state.
- Keep the title concise and action-oriented.

Examples:

- `chore: establish unified agent issue formatting standards`
- `feat: add customer import validation`
- `fix: prevent tenant leakage in customer list`
- `refactor: split feature flag resolution service`
- `build: add cli issue creation command`
- `qa: exploratory sysadmin QA session`

For epic issues, use a normal Conventional Commit title and apply the `epic` label:

- `feat: customer lifecycle automation epic`
- `chore: developer workflow automation epic`

## Minimum Required Labels

Every new issue must have at least:

1. **One primary type/domain label** — `feature`, `bug`, `dx`, `tooling`, `documentation`, or `qa` (choose the one that best describes the primary work)
2. **A lifecycle label** — `drafted-by:<agent>` when the issue is created or drafted by an agent

The type/domain label requirement applies to every new issue, human or agent-created. The `drafted-by:<agent>` requirement applies only when the issue is created or drafted by an agent. An issue missing its primary type/domain label, or missing `drafted-by:<agent>` when agent-created, is incomplete and must be corrected before work begins.

The `drafted-by:<agent>` label must name the runtime that actually created or materially drafted the issue in the current session. Do not copy the label from an adapter file, a previous issue, a prompt example, or the user's preferred agent. If the correct runtime-specific label does not exist, create it before opening the issue or immediately correct the issue after creation.

Examples:

| Created by | Minimum labels                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Human      | `feature`                         |
| Claude     | `feature`, `drafted-by:claude`    |
| Codex      | `bug`, `drafted-by:codex`         |
| Agy        | `dx`, `drafted-by:agy`            |
| Pi         | `tooling`, `drafted-by:pi`        |
| QA agent   | `qa`, `drafted-by:<actual-agent>` |

Additional routing and lifecycle labels (`for-implementation:<agent>`, `implemented-by:<agent>`, etc.) are applied as work progresses. They supplement — never replace — the minimum required set.

## Canonical Labels

Use this canonical label vocabulary for new issues and issue updates.

### Type and Domain Labels

- `epic` - parent tracking issue with a GitHub task list of child issues
- `feature` - user-facing product capability
- `bug` - defect, regression, security bug, or broken behavior
- `dx` - developer experience, agent workflow, repository workflow, or contributor experience work
- `tooling` - CLI tooling, automation, scripts, CI helpers, or local developer tools
- `documentation` - documentation-first work where docs are the primary deliverable or review surface
- `qa` - exploratory QA sessions, QA planning/execution, or QA evidence work
- `exploratory` - exploratory/manual test-session scope marker used with `qa` issues

Apply secondary labels only when they describe the primary work or a meaningful review queue. Do not add `documentation` merely because an implementation issue includes docs updates in its acceptance criteria; use it when the issue is documentation-first or when documentation review is the main work surface.

### Test Debt Labels

- `needs-test` — applied by the `qa-expert` role at bug issue creation; removed by the `tester` role only after a regression test (`*.spec.ts` or `*.e2e.ts`) is committed and passing in the fix PR. A bug PR that closes a `needs-test` issue without adding or modifying a test file must explain why in `## Agent review`.

### Agent Routing Labels

- `for-implementation:<agent>` - route implementation work to an agent

Examples:

- `for-implementation:codex`
- `for-implementation:claude`
- `for-implementation:agy`

Routing labels express a preference, not proof that the issue is eligible for a workflow profile
or provider. Lane B is provider-neutral; Agy is preferred for documentation, multimodal work,
and broad discovery, but is never an independent review signer. Run the deterministic bounded-work
validator before treating any issue as bounded.

### Agent Lifecycle Labels

- `drafted-by:<agent>` - issue, plan, or spec was drafted by the named agent/runtime in the current session
- `implemented-by:<agent>` - implementation was completed by an agent
- `for-review:<agent>` - review is requested from an agent
- `reviewed-by:<agent>` - review was completed by an agent

Examples:

- `drafted-by:codex`
- `implemented-by:agy`
- `for-review:claude`
- `reviewed-by:codex`

Use lowercase agent slugs. Keep labels specific: prefer one routing label and one lifecycle label over a generic ownership label. Provenance labels are factual audit metadata: never use `drafted-by:claude`, `drafted-by:codex`, `drafted-by:agy`, or `drafted-by:pi` unless that agent/runtime actually drafted the issue.
Update one workflow-status issue comment as work progresses. Do not create a comment for every
internal phase or evidence role.

## Deprecated Labels

Legacy `agent:*` labels are forbidden for new work.

Do not add labels such as:

- `agent:codex`
- `agent:claude`
- `agent:agy`

When modifying an existing issue that still has an `agent:*` label, do not preserve that pattern for new state. If the meaning is clear, replace it with the specific lifecycle or routing label:

- Replace assignment intent with `for-implementation:<agent>`.
- Replace completed implementation state with `implemented-by:<agent>`.
- Replace requested review state with `for-review:<agent>`.
- Replace completed review state with `reviewed-by:<agent>`.
