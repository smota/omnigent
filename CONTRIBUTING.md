# Contributing to Omnigent

Thanks for your interest in improving Omnigent. Issues and pull requests are
welcome. For larger changes, open an issue first so we can discuss the approach.

configuration in issues, tests, examples, or logs.

## Development setup

This is a Python package with an optional frontend under `web/`. Use
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for local development.

**Supported dev OS:** macOS, Linux, WSL2, and native Windows for
core/server/web workflows. POSIX terminal-wrapper coverage is still
Linux/macOS/WSL-only: `pexpect`, `pyte`, raw PTY, tmux control-mode,
`termios`, `fcntl`, Unix signals, and fork-specific tests are marked
`posix_only` and intentionally skipped on native Windows. Use the
[Windows QA matrix](docs/windows/qa-matrix.md) to decide which native
PowerShell checks, screenshots, and known-gap notes are required for
Windows-facing PRs.

Install local prerequisites first:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for Python
  environments and dependency management.
- `tmux`, required on Linux/macOS for POSIX native terminal-wrapper tests
  (`brew install tmux` on macOS, or `apt install tmux` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- `psmux`, required on native Windows for Omnigent-managed interactive
  terminals.
- `bubblewrap` (`bwrap`), **Linux only**, used to OS-sandbox native
  terminals (`apt install bubblewrap` on Debian/Ubuntu). macOS uses the
  built-in `seatbelt` sandbox and needs nothing extra; Windows uses Job Object
  process containment, not filesystem/network isolation parity.
- Node.js 22 LTS or newer with `npm` when working on `web/`.

POSIX shell setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent.git
cd omnigent

uv python install
uv venv --python "$(cat .python-version)"
uv sync --extra all --extra dev
source .venv/bin/activate    # or prefix commands with `uv run`
```

Native Windows PowerShell setup:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent.git
cd omnigent

uv python install
uv venv --python (Get-Content .python-version)
uv sync --extra all --extra dev
```

Common checks:

```bash
uv run pytest                      # full POSIX suite on Linux/macOS/WSL
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Native Windows supported subset:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows_safe_pytest.ps1 -StableOnly
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

For broad non-blocking Windows collection, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows_safe_pytest.ps1 -CollectOnly
```

When touching `web/`:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Running locally

To try your changes, start a local server, register your machine as a host,
and run the frontend dev server. Use three separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: local server on :6767
omnigent server

# Terminal 2: register your machine as a host
omnigent host --server http://localhost:6767

# Terminal 3: frontend dev server
cd web
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL from the frontend dev server, usually
`http://localhost:5173/`. The host registration is what lets the web UI browse
your filesystem and start new sessions on your machine — without it, the web UI
is read/continue-only.

`omni` is an alias for `omnigent`, so `omni host --server ...` works too.
The host URL can also be passed positionally (`omnigent host
http://localhost:6767`). See the [README](README.md) for more on hosts,
harnesses, and credentials.

### Backend-only local development validation

Use this when you want to validate the Python backend and local API server from
a source checkout without building the web UI, configuring provider
credentials, creating sessions, or running agents -- a quick server/API smoke
check on your working copy or current `main`.

[`scripts/backend-smoke.sh`](scripts/backend-smoke.sh) automates it:

```bash
scripts/backend-smoke.sh              # boots on port 18080
PORT=18090 scripts/backend-smoke.sh   # override the port if 18080 is busy
```

It installs `uv` into a throwaway toolchain venv, runs `uv sync --frozen`,
starts the server in API-only mode (`OMNIGENT_SKIP_WEB_UI=true`), waits for
`/health`, and smoke-tests `/`, `/health`, `/docs`, `/v1/agents`, and
`/v1/sessions` -- expecting HTTP `200` from all five. It exits non-zero if any
check fails.

Notes:

- **Requires `bash` or `zsh`** (the script's `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
  guarantees this); it is not POSIX-`sh` portable. **Also needs** Python 3.12+
  as `python3`, `git`, `curl`, and network access to PyPI. No provider
  credentials are needed. **Works on Linux and macOS.**
- **Fully isolated, disposable:** every artifact -- the toolchain and project
  venvs, config, data, the SQLite database, artifacts, logs, and `pip`/`uv`
  caches -- lives under one `mktemp -d` runtime directory removed on exit, so
  the run never touches your real `~/.omnigent`, `~/.config` / `~/Library`, or
  package caches. `HOME` is the primary isolation lever (it redirects
  `~/.config` on Linux and `~/Library` on macOS); the explicit `UV_*` / `PIP_*`
  / `OMNIGENT_*` overrides pin the toolchain and app state regardless of OS,
  and `XDG_*` are set so an `XDG_*` already exported in your shell cannot
  redirect state back to your real home.
- **What it does not cover:** the web UI, mobile access, human-in-the-loop
  approval flows, provider-backed sessions, or agent execution. Use the full
  local development flow above when working on those areas.

## Tests

A change that alters behaviour under `omnigent/` should ship with a test, and a
bug fix should add a test that fails before the fix. Pure refactors, renames,
type-only changes, dependency bumps, and edits with no observable behaviour
change don't need a new test.

Prefer the smallest test that covers the change. A fast, focused **unit test**
in the area suite is the default and what most changes need. Reach for
`tests/integration/` only when behaviour genuinely spans components, and for
`tests/e2e/` only for full-stack flows that a unit test can't capture — these
are slower and (for e2e) gateway-bound, so don't use them where a unit test
would do.

Put the test in the suite that matches the area you changed — most backend
areas mirror their source directory under `tests/`:

| Area changed (`omnigent/…`) | Test suite (`tests/…`) |
| --- | --- |
| `server/` | `server/` |
| `runner/` | `runner/` |
| `runtime/` | `runtime/` |
| `tools/` | `tools/` |
| `inner/` | `inner/` |
| `llms/` | `llms/` |
| `db/` | `db/` (a schema migration especially warrants one) |
| `policies/` | `policies/` |
| `repl/` | `repl/` |
| `entities/` | `entities/` |
| `stores/` | `stores/` |
| `host/` | `host/` |
| `spec/` | `spec/` |

Two cross-cutting suites sit on top of these:

- `tests/integration/` — behaviour that spans several components (e.g. server +
  runtime) and isn't captured by any single area's unit test.
- `tests/e2e/` — full-stack flows driven against a live LLM (sessions, the
  runtime, sub-agent dispatch, client-tool tunneling, transports, native
  harness bridges, steering/cancellation). These are slow and gateway-bound, so
  reserve them for genuine end-to-end behaviour — but a PR that adds new
  user-facing functionality **must** include at least one e2e happy-path test
  (see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).

### Frontend (`web/`)

Frontend changes follow the same expectation with a different toolchain:

- Add or update a **colocated Vitest test** — a `*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx` file
  next to the component or module you changed — and run it with `npm test`.
- A change to **user-facing UI behaviour** also needs a Playwright test under
  `tests/e2e_ui/`. This one is enforced mechanically by the `E2E UI Required`
  check, so a UI PR won't merge without a covering test (or a maintainer
  waiver) — see `.github/workflows/e2e-ui-required.yml`.
- Styling/formatting-only changes, copy tweaks with no flow change, and
  refactors with no behaviour change are exempt, same as the backend.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`, keep changes focused, and include tests or docs when relevant.
- Sign off your commits with `git commit -s` (Developer Certificate of Origin).
- Fill in the PR template. For **UI / frontend changes**, check the
  "UI / frontend change" box and attach a **video or images** in the `Demo`
  section showing the new behaviour, so reviewers can see it without checking
  out the branch.
